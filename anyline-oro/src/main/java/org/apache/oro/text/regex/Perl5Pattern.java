/**
 * An implementation of the Pattern interface for Perl5 regular expressions.
 * This class is compatible with the Perl5Compiler and Perl5Matcher
 * classes.  When a Perl5Compiler instance compiles a regular expression
 * pattern, it produces a Perl5Pattern instance containing internal
 * data structures used by Perl5Matcher to perform pattern matches.
 * This class cannot be subclassed and
 * cannot be directly instantiated by the programmer as it would not
 * make sense.  Perl5Pattern instances should only be created through calls
 * to a Perl5Compiler instance's compile() methods.  The class implements
 * the Serializable interface so that instances may be pre-compiled and
 * saved to disk if desired.
 *
 * @version @version@
