/**
 * The PatternMatcher interface defines the operations a regular
 * expression matcher must implement.  However, the types of the Pattern 
 * implementations recognized by a matcher are not restricted.  Typically
 * PatternMatcher instances will only recognize a specific type of Pattern.
 * For example, the Perl5Matcher only recognizes Perl5Pattern instances.
 * However, none of the PatternMatcher methods are required to throw an
 * exception in case of the use of an invalid pattern.  This is done for
 * efficiency reasons, although usually a CastClassException will be
 * thrown by the Java runtime system if you use the wrong Pattern
 * implementation.  It is the responsibility of the programmer to make
 * sure he uses the correct Pattern instance with a given PatternMatcher
 * instance.  The current version of this package only contains the Perl5
 * suite of pattern matching classes, but future ones for other regular
 * expression grammars may be added and users may also create their own
 * implementations of the provided interfaces. Therefore the programmer
 * should be careful not to mismatch classes.
