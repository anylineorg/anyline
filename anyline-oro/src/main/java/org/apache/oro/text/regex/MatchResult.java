/**
 * The MatchResult interface allows PatternMatcher implementors to return
 * results storing match information in whatever format they like, while
 * presenting a consistent way of accessing that information.  However,
 * MatchResult implementations should strictly follow the behavior
 * described for the interface methods.
 * <p>
 *
 * A MatchResult instance contains a pattern match and its saved groups.
 * You can access the entire match directly using the
 * {@link #group(int)} method with an argument of 0,
 * or by the {@link #toString()} method which is
 * defined to return the same thing.  It is also possible to obtain
 * the beginning and ending offsets of a match relative to the input
 * producing the match by using the 
 * {@link #beginOffset(int)} and {@link #endOffset(int)} methods.  The
 * {@link #begin(int)} and {@link #end(int)} are useful in some
 * circumstances and return the begin and end offsets of the subgroups
 * of a match relative to the beginning of the match.
 * <p>
 *
 * You might use a MatchResult as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * int groups;
 * PatternMatcher matcher;
 * PatternCompiler compiler;
 * Pattern pattern;
 * PatternMatcherInput input;
 * MatchResult result;
 *
 * compiler = new Perl5Compiler();
 * matcher  = new Perl5Matcher();
 *
 * try {
 *   pattern = compiler.compile(somePatternString);
 * } catch(MalformedPatternException e) {
 *   System.out.println("Bad pattern.");
 *   System.out.println(e.toString());
 *   return;
 * }
 *
 * input   = new PatternMatcherInput(someStringInput);
 *
 * while(matcher.contains(input, pattern)) {
 *   result = matcher.getMatch();  
 *   // Perform whatever processing on the result you want.
 *   // Here we just print out all its elements to show how its
 *   // methods are used.
 * 
 *   System.out.println("Match: " + result.toString());
 *   System.out.println("Length: " + result.length());
 *   groups = result.groups();
 *   System.out.println("Groups: " + groups);
 *   System.out.println("Begin offset: " + result.beginOffset(0));
 *   System.out.println("End offset: " + result.endOffset(0));
 *   System.out.println("Saved Groups: ");
 *
 *   // Start at 1 because we just printed out group 0
 *   for(int group = 1; group < groups; group++) {
 *	 System.out.println(group + ": " + result.group(group));
 *	 System.out.println("Begin: " + result.begin(group));
 *	 System.out.println("End: " + result.end(group));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>

  /**
   * A convenience method returning the length of the entire match.
   * If you want to get the length of a particular subgroup you should
   * use the {@link #group(int)} method to get
   * the string and then access its length() method as follows:
   * <p>
   * <blockquote><pre>
   * int length = -1; // Use -1 to indicate group doesn't exist
   * MatchResult result;

   *
