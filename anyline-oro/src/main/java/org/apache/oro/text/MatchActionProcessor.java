/**
 * The MatchActionProcessor class provides AWK-like line by line filtering
 * of a text stream, pattern action pair association, and field splitting
 * based on a registered separator.  However, the class can be used with
 * any compatible PatternMatcher/PatternCompiler implementations and
 * need not use the AWK matching classes in org.apache.oro.text.awk.  In fact,
 * the default matcher and compiler used by the class are Perl5Matcher and
 * Perl5Compiler from org.apache.oro.text.regex.
 * <p>
 * To completely understand how to use MatchActionProcessor, you should first
 * look at {@link MatchAction} and {@link MatchActionInfo}.
 * A MatchActionProcessor is first initialized with
 * the desired PatternCompiler and PatternMatcher instances to use to compile
 * patterns and perform matches.  Then, optionally, a field separator may
 * be registered with {@link #setFieldSeparator setFieldSeparator()}
 * Finally, as many pattern action pairs as desired are registerd with
 * {@link #addAction addAction()} before processing the input
 * with {@link #processMatches processMatches()}.  Pattern action
 * pairs are processed in the order they were registered.
 * <p>
 * The look of added actions can closely mirror that of AWK when anonymous
 * classes are used.  Here's an example of how you might use
 * MatchActionProcessor to extract only the second column of a semicolon
 * delimited file:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * import java.io.*;
 *
 * import org.apache.oro.text.*;
 * import org.apache.oro.text.regex.*;
 *
 * final class semicolon {
 *
 *  public static final void main(String[] args) {
 *    MatchActionProcessor processor = new MatchActionProcessor();
 *
 *    try {
 *      processor.setFieldSeparator(";");
 *      // Using a null pattern means to perform the action for every line.
 *      processor.addAction(null, new MatchAction() {
 *        public void processMatch(MatchActionInfo info) {
 *	    // We assume the second column exists
 *          info.output.println(info.fields.elementAt(1));
 *        }
 *     });
 *   } catch(MalformedPatternException e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();
 *     System.exit(1);
 *   }
 *
 *   try {
 *      processor.processMatches(System.in, System.out);
 *   } catch(IOException e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();
 *     System.exit(1);
 *   }
 *  }
 *}
 * </pre>
 * You can redirect the following sample input to stdin to test the code:
 * <pre>
 * 1;Trenton;New Jersey
 * 2;Annapolis;Maryland
 * 3;Austin;Texas
 * 4;Richmond;Virginia
 * 5;Harrisburg;Pennsylvania
