/**
 * The PatternCompiler interface defines the operations a regular
 * expression compiler must implement.  However, the types of
 * regular expressions recognized by a compiler and the Pattern 
 * implementations produced as a result of compilation are not
 * restricted.
 * <p>
 * A PatternCompiler instance is used to compile the string representation
 * (either as a String or char[]) of a regular expression into a Pattern
 * instance.  The Pattern can then be used in conjunction with the appropriate
 * PatternMatcher instance to perform pattern searches.  A form
 * of use might be:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * PatternCompiler compiler;
 * PatternMatcher matcher;
 * Pattern pattern;
 * String input;
 *
 * // Initialization of compiler, matcher, and input omitted;
 *
 * try {
 *   pattern = compiler.compile("\\d+");
 * } catch(MalformedPatternException e) {
 *   System.out.println("Bad pattern.");
 *   System.out.println(e.toString());
 *   System.exit(1);
 * }
 * 
 *
 * if(matcher.matches(input, pattern))
 *    System.out.println(input + " is a number");
 * else
 *    System.out.println(input + " is not a number");
 *
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Specific PatternCompiler implementations such as Perl5Compiler may have
 * variations of the compile() methods that take extra options affecting
 * the compilation of a pattern.  However, the PatternCompiler method
 * implementations should provide the default behavior of the class.
