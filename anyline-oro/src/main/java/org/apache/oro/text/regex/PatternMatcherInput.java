/**
 * The PatternMatcherInput class is used to preserve state across
 * calls to the <code>contains()</code> methods of PatternMatcher instances.
 * It is also used to specify that only a subregion of a string
 * should be used as input when looking for a pattern match.  All that
 * is meant by preserving state is that the end offset of the last match
 * is remembered, so that the next match is performed from that point
 * where the last match left off.  This offset can be accessed from
 * the {@link #getCurrentOffset()} method and can be set with the
 * {@link #setCurrentOffset(int)} method.
 * <p>
 * You would use a PatternMatcherInput object when you want to search for
 * more than just the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, or when
 * you only want to search a subregion of the string for a match.  An
 * example of its most common use is:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * PatternMatcher matcher;
 * PatternCompiler compiler;
 * Pattern pattern;
 * PatternMatcherInput input;
 * MatchResult result;
 *
 * compiler = new Perl5Compiler();
 * matcher  = new Perl5Matcher();
 *
 * try {
 *   pattern = compiler.compile(somePatternString);
 * } catch(MalformedPatternException e) {
 *   System.out.println("Bad pattern.");
 *   System.out.println(e.toString());
 *   return;
 * }
 *
 * input   = new PatternMatcherInput(someStringInput);
 *
 * while(matcher.contains(input, pattern)) {
 *   result = matcher.getMatch();  
 *   // Perform whatever processing on the result you want.
 * }
 * // Suppose we want to start searching from the beginning again with
 * // a different pattern.
 * // Just set the current offset to the begin offset.
 * input.setCurrentOffset(input.getBeginOffset());
 *
 * // Second search omitted
 *
 * // Suppose we're done with this input, but want to search another string.
 * // There's no need to create another PatternMatcherInput instance.
 * // We can just use the setInput() method.
 * input.setInput(aNewInputString);
 *
 * </pre></blockquote>
